import pygame
pygame.init()
-->>This will initiate PyGame, and allow you to then make various commands with PyGame and our game.

gameDisplay = pygame.display.set_mode((800,600))

--->>> we want the resolution of our game to be 800 px wide and 600 px tall. Take note that this is a tuple as a function argument

pygame.display.set_caption('A bit Racey')
--->title of our window

clock = pygame.time.Clock()
--->>game clock
---->> use this to track time within the game, and this is mostly used for FPS, or "frames per second."
----->>average human eye can see ~30 FPS. and beyond that people cant see the difference.

crashed = False

while not crashed:

    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            crashed = True

        print(event)

    pygame.display.update()
    clock.tick(60)// how many frames per second we are running. In this case, we are running 60 FPS.

---->>After our if statement. you'll see that we run a pygame.display.update
----->>Display.flip will update the entire surface Basically the entire screen. 
------->>Display.update can just update specific areas of the screen. That said, if you do not pass a parameter, then update will update the entire surface as well,
pygame.quit()
quit()
-->>Once we have broken our game loop, we want to run a pygame.quit(). This will end our pygame instance.
--->>we can run a simple quit(), which will exit Python and the application.

if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:
                x_change = -5
            elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
                x_change = 5
        if event.type == pygame.KEYUP:
            if event.key == pygame.K_LEFT or event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
                x_change = 0

-->>Easy enough if we break this down. First, we're asking if the event is a keydown event, which means if there is any key being pressed. Later, we can combine all of this into 1 statement, but here I'd like to keep things as simple as possible. So, is there a key being pressed? If so, is that key a LEFT arrow key? If it is, then our x_change is -5. If the KEYDOWN is a RIGHT arrow key, then x_change is 5. Finally, if the key change is actually a KEYUP, meaning if we have released a key, then x_change is 0.
x += x_change

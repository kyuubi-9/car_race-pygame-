def things(thingx, thingy, thingw, thingh, color):
    pygame.draw.rect(gameDisplay, color, [thingx, thingy, thingw, thingh])

-->>we use pygame.draw.rect() to draw the polygon to our specifications. The parameters to this function are : where, what color, and then the x,y location followed by the width and the height.

thing_startx = random.randrange(0,display_width)
    thing_starty = -600
    thing_speed = 7

    thing_width = 100
    thing_height = 100

------>>we specify the object's speed. This is how many pixels at a time will it move. Right now, per frame, this block will move 7 pixels. We can increase or decrease this number to directly affect difficulty.

Finally, we define the blocks width and height. 

if thing_starty > display_height:
            thing_starty = 0 - thing_height
            thing_startx = random.randrange(0,display_width)
--->>once it has passed us, it will just keep going forever. We need some handling, like the handling we used with our car, to create another block once one has moved off of the screen.
